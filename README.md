# AcousticAlchemy
This project addresses the challenges of audio processing through an integrated approach, focusing on audio mixing, noise filtering, and reverberation. 

## PROJECT DETAILS
Embarking on the forefront of audio innovation, our Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project seeks to redefine auditory experiences. Focused on audio mixing, noise removal, reverberation, and various audio processes, our endeavor combines advanced signal processing techniques. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances sound quality but also finds applications in diverse fields, from immersive entertainment to effective noise cancellation in communication systems. Join us in reshaping the auditory landscape through the fusion of technology and sound engineering expertise.

## METHODOLOGY
The project methodology entails loading original speech and noise audio files, mixing them based on a specified ratio, and plotting the time domain of the resulting audio. The mixed audio is saved before applying the Ephraim-Malah algorithm for noise removal, visualizing the denoised time domain, and saving the denoised audio. Subsequently, a reverb effect is applied, and the time domain of the reverberated audio is plotted. The final audio, combining denoising and reverb, is saved, and the frequency domain of the mixed audio is visualized. This structured workflow, utilizing libraries like librosa, ensures a systematic approach to audio processing, incorporating visualizations to assess the impact of each processing step.
